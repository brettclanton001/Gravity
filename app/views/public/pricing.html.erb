<h1>Pricing</h1>

<p>
  Gravity offers variable pricing to keep things fair. What you pay each month
  is directly related to your usage.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>First 1GB Storage or 10GB Bandwidth is Free ( No Credit Card Required ).</li>
  <li>$0.06 Per 1GB Transfered in Pay Period* + Credit Card Processing Fees</li>
  <li>Minimum: $0.50</li>
  <li>Maximum: $5.00</li>
</ul>

<h3>Variable Pricing Calculation</h3>

<p>
  The "$0.06 Per 1GB Transfered in Pay Period + Credit Card Processing Fees" calculations
  are based on the overhead costs of GravityApp.co and the direct costs your account
  accrues for us. The Credit Card Processing Fees are currently $0.30 per transaction plus
  2.9% of the transaction amount.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>* The "$0.06 Per 1GB Transfered in Pay Period"
  pricing calculation may change later</strong>, but any change would be clearly explained
  to existing users in a direct email.  We are committed to preserving both the
  minimum and the maximum costs per month, so those will not change.
</p>

<h3>Why the $0.50 Minimum?</h3>

<p>
  Our infrastructure costs require a minimum cost to keep the service going.
  Our credit card processing service has a minimum charge value of $0.50, and
  so we have also adopted that as a minimum.  You might notice that a good
  amount of usage will still be covered by the $0.50 monthly cost, and mostly
  only power users will see their cost higher than that.
</p>

<h3>Why the $5.00 Maximum?</h3>

<p>
  Gravity want’s to keep things simple and provide an easy user
  experience.  We think a solid maximum charge helps with that experience.  We
  will not charge any user more than $5/month, so don’t worry about using the
  app on a large scale!
